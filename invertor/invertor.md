## Introduction

- CMOS inverters (Complementary NOSFET Inverters) are some of the most widely used and adaptable MOSFET inverters used in chip design. They operate with very little power loss and at relatively high speed. Furthermore, the CMOS inverter has good logic buffer characteristics, in that, its noise margins in both low and high states are large.

- A CMOS inverter contains a PMOS and a NMOS transistor connected at the drain and gate terminals, a supply voltage VDD at the PMOS source terminal, and a ground connected at the NMOS source terminal, were VIN is connected to the gate terminals and VOUT is connected to the drain terminals.(See diagram). It is important to notice that the CMOS does not contain any resistors, which makes it more power efficient that a regular resistor-MOSFET inverter. As the voltage at the input of the CMOS device varies between 0 and 5 volts, the state of the NMOS and PMOS varies accordingly. If we model each transistor as a simple switch activated by VIN, the inverterâ€™s operations can be seen very easily:
